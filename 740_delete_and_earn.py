            // Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
                    Reduce this problem to house robber, for each number
                    we take a decision to choose the current number or not.
                    If we donot choose the current number,
                        we can simply take the max of the previous_chosen and
                        previous_not_chosen
                    If we are deciding to choose a number, there are two possibilites -
                        1) If the immediate previous number exists, then we cannot choose it.
                           But we can choose the previous_not_chosen (the sum we would
                           have got if we had not chosen the previous number) plus the
                           current number
                        2) If the immediate previous number does not exists, then we have an option
                           to choose it as well because the question demands to only not choose the
                           number-1 . Now we can take the max of the previous_chosen and
                           previous_not_chosen plus the current number.
