#   Time Complexity : O(RxC) Where R is no of Rows and C is no of Columns
#  Space Complexity : O(1) Any extra space is not used.
#  Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
#  Any problem you faced while coding this : This question looks similer to the house paint problem. It is similer if instead of three color we have variable number of color.
