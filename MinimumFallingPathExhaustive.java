/*
Let N be the length of matrix.

Time Complexity: O(Nâ‹…3^N)
    The solution takes the form of a 3-ary recursion tree where there are 3 possibilities for every node in the tree.
    The time complexity can be derived as follows,
    The maximum depth of the recursion tree is equal to the number of rows in the matrix i.e N.
    Each level (level) of the recursion tree will contain approximately 3
    level nodes. For example, at level 0 there are 3 nodes, for level 1, 3 nodes, and so on. Thus, the maximum number of
    nodes at level N would be approximately 3N.

    The time complexity is exponential, hence this approach is exhaustive and results in Time Limit Exceeded (TLE).

Space Complexity: O(N) This space will be used to store the recursion stack. As the maximum depth of the tree is N,
    we will not have more than N recursive calls on the call stack at any time.
