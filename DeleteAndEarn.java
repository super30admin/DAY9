//TC: O(n), n:maximum element in nums array
//SC: O(n)
//Approach:
//1. We reduce the problem to house robber, where we have to see just if either we delete this coin and earn, or we don't.
//2. To reduce the prblem to that level, complication lies in the fact that we don't the array sorted + we don't know the neighbors of any array element.
//3. We take another array of size equal to the maximum element in the given array, and fill this array with the given array elements, in such a way that
// element i goes to the index i, so [1,2,2,3] becomes, [0,1,4,3].
//4. Now, the problem is reduced and we can simply apply DP here where for every element we have 2 cases, choose or don't choose.
