#In the code, I solved the "Minimum Falling Path Sum" problem using dynamic programming. I first determined the number of rows and columns in the matrix and initialized a dp table to store the minimum path sums. I copied the first row of the matrix to the first row of dp. For each subsequent row, I calculated the minimum path sum for each cell by considering the values directly above, above-left, and above-right from the previous row, handling boundary conditions. Finally, I returned the minimum value from the last row of dp. 
#The time complexity is O(R×C), where R is the number of rows and C is the number of columns. The space complexity is O(R×C) due to the dp table.

class Solution:
    def minFallingPathSum(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        R=len(matrix)
        C=len(matrix[0])
        dp=[[None]*C for _ in range(R)]
        for i in range(C):
            dp[0][i]=matrix[0][i]
        for i in range(1,R):
            for j in range(C):
                v=dp[i-1][j]
                if j-1>=0:
                    v=min(v,dp[i-1][j-1])
                if j+1<C:
                    v=min(v,dp[i-1][j+1])
                dp[i][j]=v+matrix[i][j]
        return min(dp[R-1])
